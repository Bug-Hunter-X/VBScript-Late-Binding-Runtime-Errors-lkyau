Early Binding and Error Handling:
The best way to avoid late binding issues is to use early binding whenever possible. This requires explicitly declaring object types.  If early binding isn't feasible, implement thorough error handling to gracefully manage runtime failures.
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error creating object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  ' Code to use obj
End If
```
Alternatively, use early binding:
```vbscript
Dim obj as Object 'Or more specific type if known
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object")
' ... use obj ...
Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
  MsgBox "Error creating object: " & Err.Description
End Sub
```
